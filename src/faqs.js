    question: 'Are miracles real?',
    answer:
      "What seems like a miracle to us is not a miracle to God.  God is all powerful.  The question of miracles rests on belief in God.  If there is a God and more specifically if the God of the Bible is real, then miracles are possible and they are real.",

    question: 'How can I experience a miracle?',
    answer:
      "God’s Word is the most important step to receive a miracle. Romans 10:17 says, “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” You can’t just know the Word intellectually. You must meditate on it so it becomes living and active on the inside of you."
